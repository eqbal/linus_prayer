# A simple pray for Linus

An open source prayer to Linus Torvalds.

```
Our Linus, Who art in Linux

Open be thy source

Thy release come

Thy kernel be run

On mobile as it is on servers

Give us this day our daily commit

And forgive us our pull requests

As we forgive those who fork our code

And lead us not into mac-os

But deliver us from Microsoft.

Sudo.
```
